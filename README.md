# holberton-headphones

## About

In this project we take a FIGMA design file for Holberton Headphones and build it in a step by step process. 

## Requirements

Use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.
you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
you are not to use Javascript
reset CSS styling
use variables
simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible

## Task 0 ReadMe

Create an account in Figma and open this [project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/UWz3iOOx9ZSpwKRjLpYHoQ) and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

If you can’t access to it, please find here the [Figma file](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Ec1-9OpNim5R_yk0ZDV-_Q)

## Task 1 Header
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
use variables
simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

## Task 2 What We Do
For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: [holberton_school-icon.zip](https://holbertonintranet.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/misc/2020/3/7159d988278de54d859d.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOU5BHMTQX4%2F20220627%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220627T214655Z&X-Amz-Expires=345600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=04c9524276fc4263af17a99710b2e61bc954518e591d07deea22dee25c39c52f) Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.


## Task 3 Our Results


For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

## Task 4 Contact us
Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

## Task 5 Footer
Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!

When you are done, here the result:
